[details]
# Additional details
The current jobs.txt syntax requires that normal cronjobs be prepended with '#' while ProfileGem jobs are not, which is confusing - a regular line should read like a cronjob.  cronBuild.py and known jobs.txt files should be refactored to be valid crontab files by default.
